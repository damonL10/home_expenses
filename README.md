Home Expenses (家頭算務) is a  web application designed for my family members to conveniently housekeep daily household expenses. 
This has been deployed via AWS services. 
How to use ? Just simply login at the front page of 家頭算務, select the expense category and input the expense amount. 
And then how much daily/ monthly/ yearly household expenses grouped by expense category could be easily traced and seen in the respective table and chart.

If you have any queries/ comments, please feel free to contact Damon.
